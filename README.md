# Signal Studio

**Signal Studio** is an interactive application designed for signal processing enthusiasts and engineers. This tool enables users to:

- Visualize signals in real-time.
- Sample signals and adjust the sampling rate.
- Observe the differences between original and sampled signals in the time domain.
- Analyze signals in the frequency domain, allowing users to understand the impact of sampling on signal fidelity.

With Signal Studio, users can explore the effects of sampling rate changes on both the time and frequency domains, making it an ideal tool for learning and experimentation in signal processing.
